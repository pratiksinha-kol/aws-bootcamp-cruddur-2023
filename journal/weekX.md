# Week X â€” Cleanup

## Homework Task Performed for Week X

_For this last week of bootcamp, we have to make chnages and refactor few things so that our application runs without running into any issues on production. All these while we have performing our task on Gitpod and now its time to modify our application that it works without Gitpod_

_Since, we have already implemented Cloudformation for our services such as VPC, RDS Database, Fargate, ECS Backend service, DynamoDB and CICD, we have to integrate it with our production environment._
